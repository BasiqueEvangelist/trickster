-> number (2)

---

Returns the number two, always.

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Note: Inscribed Spells|>A spell can be inscribed onto any item that a player can hold in their inventory.
If inscribed on a block, the spell will be removed if the block is placed.


Some items may have additional interactions with inscribed spells, 
[Wands](^trickster:wand) for example will cast the spell automatically when right-clicked.

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:read_spell,title=Notulist's Delusion|>
